<p align="center">We are a small server group offering vanilla servers for sourcemods and small titles.<br><br>
Here, you can have fun without your PC exploding due to <i>"""cool"""</i> titles or effects.</p>

<p align="center">On our PF2 server, you can experience the beauty of a large and varied map pool (<b><i>all the maps nobody else wanted to host!</i></b>) with vanilla gameplay, bhop, and configurable Quake announcer sounds.
All the essentials required for a good time without being too annoying.</p>

{% alert (tip=true) %}
Rest assured, this server will not do the equivalent of bitcoin mining via a stupid animation like a **_certain_** server.
