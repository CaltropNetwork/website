Out of the blue I recieved a random request through the form (the map name was `pl_haywood`, but it doesn't matter):

{{ image(url="email.jpg", no_hover=true ) }}
 
Clicking the world's least suspicious link led me to this fun google drive folder:

{{ image(url="folder.png", no_hover=true, full_bleed=true ) }}

Contained within were a bunch of old TF2 maps (that you probably know) (therefore compaptible with PF2 out of the box), and this video:

{{ video(url="gift for raspy.mp4" controls=true ) }}

Out of the list, I have added the following maps:

## New Maps

- `cp_desertfortress`
- `cp_dock2_v1`
- `cp_smbcastle2` (storm a real Source™️ castle)
- `cp_warehouse_v8` (killhouse with shipping containeers)
- `cp_wolf2_b1` (of Knockout TF2C fame)
- `falling_cp` (just see for yourself)
- `ctf_hallofdeath` (what if the flags were right across from eachother?)
- `ctf_ig_area_v2` (grenade jumpers heaven)
- `ctf_shooting_gallery_b3` (BLU runs to the flag around a ring while RED snipes at them from a box)
- `ctf_snofort_final`
- `pl_donkeykong_final`
- `pl_haywood_beta5` (the requested map)
