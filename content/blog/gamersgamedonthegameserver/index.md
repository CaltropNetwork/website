Well, shortly after bringing mapvoting back, the server got really, really active.

I'm not sure if this is related to mapvoting, or PF2 recieving more attention as a whole, but it's rather interesting.

PF2's servers have been more active the last few days. Maybe some of this will spill over.

I've been thinking of building a server around maps nobody's ever heard of. The niche, weird, unique stuff like <code><a href="https://wiki.knockout.chat/index.php/EddieLTU#De_Armpit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external">de_armpit</a></code> but for TF2 (I have found some promising maps).

I could probably also include more well-known small maps like `dm_construct` or `cyberpunk`.

I'd ideally like to make it a live TF2 server, since it would stand out more there and save a ton of Hammer work, but PF2 players are the only community I have here.
