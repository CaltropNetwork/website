Here you have it!

This is the first clip of the channel:

I just took something interesting that happened on today's session and cut it quite a lot. There won't be a consistent upload schedule (yet), but I'll try to post when I can.

Also hoping to integrate demos into this once I can get `demoui` to be a little more cooperative (demos will also be public for anybody else that wants them).
