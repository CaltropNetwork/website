Welcome to our new website!

I will eventually move the final servers over soon, along with setting up Sourcebans and HLStats.

This current page is much better than the old <a href="https://bulma.io" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulma</a> one. It also includes a blog which I will use for all future updates.

## Current Updates

- Mapvoting is back! Be sure to `!nominate` within the first 5 minutes.
